text: "<p>I've been using my sewing skills to make face masks.  So far I've been churning out about 10 a day, 50 per week but itâ€™s way more than I can use.</p>\n\n<p>So if you would like some for you and your family to wear during this pandemic, just let me know. I do not want any payment but if you insist, a donation to Tsung Tsin Association of Ontario would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>These masks are made of 2 layers of 100% new cotton fabric which can be washed and reused. Between the two layers is a pocket where you can add an optional filter of your choice. The straps are made of stretchy T-shirt yarn which you can adjust for a snug fit. There is also a channel around the top section of the mask where a wire can be added for a better fit around the nose. The masks come in two sizes: Adult (including teenagers) and Youth.</p>\n\n<p>The quantities shown are the amounts at the beginning of the week, so be quick before your favourites are gone. I will be adding new masks at the beginning of each week until my fabric runs out. LOL it could be a while!</p>\n\n<p>And for you men who think the masks are not manly enough, I can assure you you'll be very attractive wearing one of these masks. \U0001F44D\U0001F642</p>"
