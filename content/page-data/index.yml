  <p>I've been using my sewing skills to make face masks.  So far I've been
  churning out about 10 a day, 50 per week but itâ€™s way more than I can use.</p>


  <p>So if you would like some for you and your family to wear during this pandemic, just let me know. I do not want any payment but if you insist, a donation to Tsung Tsin Association of Ontario would be appreciated.</p>


  <p>These masks are made of 2 layers of 100% new cotton fabric which can be washed and reused. Between the two layers is a pocket where you can add an optional filter of your choice. The straps are made of stretchy T-shirt yarn which you can adjust for a snug fit. There is also a channel around the top section of the mask where a wire can be added for a better fit around the nose. The masks come in two sizes: Adult (including teenagers) and Youth.</p>


  <p>The quantities shown are the amounts at the beginning of the week, so be quick before your favourites are gone. I will be adding new masks at the beginning of each week until my fabric runs out. LOL it could be a while!</p>


  <p>I delivered a lot of masks this week and I am currently sewing some more to be posted soon so check back in the next two days for new masks. ðŸ™‚</p>
