greeting: 👋 Hey friends
text: >-
  <p>I am Christine and I've been using my sewing skills to make face masks.  So
  far I've been churning out about 10 a day, 50 per week but it’s way more than
  I can use. My friends Rosalina and Maria also love to sew and have joined me
  making masks.</p>


  <p>So if you would like some for you and your family to wear during this pandemic, just let us know. We do not want any payment but a donation to Tsung Tsin Association of Ontario would be appreciated.</p>


  <p>These masks are made of 2 layers of 100% new cotton fabric which can be washed and reused. Between the two layers is a pocket where you can add an optional filter of your choice. The straps are made of stretchy T-shirt yarn or elastic.the masks have a wire For a better fit around the nose. Wires are either sewn in or are removable.</p>


  <p>The quantities shown are the amounts at the beginning of the week, so be quick before your favourites are gone. New masks will be added at the beginning of each week until the end of June when we will wrap up this project and enjoy the summer.</p>
