  <p>I've been making using my sewing skills to make face masks.  So far I've
  been churning out about 10 a day, 50 per week but itâ€™s way more than I can
  use.


  So if you would like some for you and your family to wear during this pandemic, just let me know. I do not want any payment but if you insist, a donation to Tsung Tsin Association of Ontario would be appreciated.


  The quantities shown are the amounts at the beginning of the week, so be quick before your favourites are gone. I will be adding about 50 at the beginning of each week until my fabric runs out. LOL it could be a while!
