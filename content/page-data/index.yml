greeting: 👋 Hey friends
text: >-
  <p>I am Christine McNamee and I've been using my sewing skills to make face
  masks.  My friends Rosalina Wong and Maria Ho Fung also love to sew and have
  joined me making masks. For six weeks in May and June, we sewed and delivered
  close to 600 masks for our community. We are taking a break to enjoy the
  summer but there are still a few masks left if you are interested.</p>


  <p>So if you would like some for you and your family to wear during this pandemic, just let us know. We do not want any payment but a donation to Tsung Tsin Association of Ontario would be appreciated.</p>


  <p>These masks are made of 2 layers of 100% new cotton fabric which can be washed and reused. Between the two layers is a pocket where you can add an optional filter of your choice. The straps are made of stretchy T-shirt yarn or elastic. The masks have a wire for a better fit around the nose. Wires are either sewn in or are removable.</p>


  <p> </p>


  <p>To make a request for masks from this site, please contact Rosalina Wong at email <a href=>rosalina2426@gmail.com</a>. Please provide mask #, size and quantity as well as your name, address, and telephone number. For anything else you can contact me at email cmcnamee1@rogers.com.


  Keep safe everyone.</p>
